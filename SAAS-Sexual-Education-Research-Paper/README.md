# Spring 2021 Independent Research Paper through SAAS Research & Publications Committee
## Notable Files:
- **[WIP] [3.16] Sexual Education Effects on LGBT Communities.ipynb**
  * Outdated python notebook for analyzing the correlation between 20+ features of States' Sexual Education Public School policies and the population and breakdown of LGBT communities in those states.
- **[SAAS] [4:7] [RP] Sexual Education Effects on LGBT communities.ipynb**
  * Completed python notebook of exploratory data analysis, classification models, and permutation testing for significance. Using Centroid classification, naive bayes classification, and recursive feature elimination for feature selection, I built classifiers with reproducible accuracies as high as 75%. However, since the data set was so small, the variance between classification trials remains very high. For future projects, I will look to expand the data set to more time periods in order to better train a classifier. Since only the 2020 census contained LGBT population data, there wasn't an easy way to expand the data set at the current time without extrapolation.
