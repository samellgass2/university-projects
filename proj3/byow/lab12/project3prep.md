# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

We didn't go to lab so we didn't see the other implementation but after finishing it, keeping track of vertices that have been changed to nothing could be helpful way to save space in later algorithms

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:

to tessalate the hexagons you have to see if there is already a hexagon in the given space around it which is similar to building rooms and hallways because you have to see if there is already a room there to build a hallway too because if there isn't then it wouldnt make any sense to build a hallway in that place 

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:

I would write a method to see if something was in a certain spot so that you can know if you need to add something.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:

They are similar in that you can be inside both of them but rooms could have things to do in those rooms but in a hallway you are just for going from room to room.
