# university-projects
### All projects done in (2019 - 2023) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- **Spotify Playlist Matcher** (10/2021)
  * *Current Undertaking: WIP. Status: App is functional, matching algorithm is not.*
  * Using Spotify's RESTful API, currently working to allow a user to log in, and then using all playlists owned by the user, can input a song and have a matching algorithm determine which playlists the song most closely matches, then with user permission, adds the song of interest to any/all suggested playlists on their account.
  * *Current state: WIP.*
- **Happpiness Tracker Proj** (8/2021)
  * As a personal passion project, I've been keeping track of several factors in my day-to-day as numerical values with the goal of assessing what forces in my life have a statistically significant impact on my happiness. Goal: expand this to some kind of generalizable model to then calculate for a given user, given local data (day, time, weather) and given patterns in the data, is able to give suggestions regarding what behavior the user should bias toward to have a "happy" day. 
  * *Current state: conceptual.*
- **Deep Learning Exploration** (7/2021)
  * While interning at VIZIO, I was able to use paperspace and the fast.ai as well as tensorflow Python packages to build a simple classification algorithm. This model determines which of 3 character classes in the game *Destiny 2* a given image belongs to. Despite general similarity in design, using just a training set of some 500 images, the model was able to fairly robustly determine if an image belonged to some class using a Convolutional Neural Network.
  * *Current state: MVP.*
- ***Call Me Ace* Internship** (5/2021)
  * While working as the *Product Marketing Intern* for Rapper *Call Me Ace*, I oversaw the marketing rollout of his album release *Out of Office*, worked to organize a team of interns to analyze and create social media content, and worked as a **campaign analyst for the BET AmpliFind Competition** during March-April 2021. Currently, Ace is a finalist, and most of the work that I've done has been collecting data and working to draw insights from it to employ in our tactics.
  * *Current state: Completed.*
- **LinkedIn consulting project** (5/2021)
  * Berkeley Club for Entertainment Careers - Spring 2021's consulting project with LinkedIn Learning at Berkeley, including related data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Jupyter notebook of data visualization, cleaning, and related functions.
  * *Current state: Completed.*
- **SAAS Sexual Education Research Paper** (4/2021)
  * With the guidance of the *Student Association for Applied Statistics* - wrote a research paper on the effects of Sexual Education policies on the LGBT communities across the United States in the last 20 years. Attached is the Jupyter notebook of data cleaning, data analysis, modeling and classification of the assembled data.
  * *Current state: Published.*
- **proj3: BYOW** (12/2020)
  * CS61B (Data Structures)'s final project in Fall 2020, the "Build Your Own World" project, here created as "CS Quest", a procedurally generated saving and loading game environment built as a CS trivia game, including robust movement systems and pseudorandomly generated game worlds as well as saving and loading
  * *Current state: Completed.*
